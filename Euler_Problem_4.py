# Description       : Solution to Problem 4 from Project Euler.
#
# Problem 4         : A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
#                     from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#                     Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
