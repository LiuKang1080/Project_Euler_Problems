# Description       : Solution to Problem 6 from Project Euler.
#
# Problem 4         : The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#                     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#                     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
#                     square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of
#                     the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
